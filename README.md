# Mycodo

## An Environmental Monitoring and Regulation System

### Latest version: 4.0.4

Mycodo is a remote monitoring and automation system with a focus on environmental regulation from sensor stimuli. Responses can be as simple as a trigger (camera capture, email notification, relay activation) or as complex as a PID controller to regulate conditions in an environment. Mycodo has been used for cultivating gourmet mushrooms, maintaining homeostatsis in a honey bee apiary, incubating eggs, aging cheeses, and more.

The system is built to run on the Raspberry Pi and aims to be easy to install and set up.

## Supported Devices and Sensors

Certain sensors will require extra steps to be taken in order to set up the interface for communication. This includes I<sup>2</sup>C, one-wire, and UART.

### Temperature

> [DS18B20](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing) (1-wire)

The DS18B20 is a simple 1-wire sensor. Once the one-wire interface has been configured with the above instructions, it may be used with Mycodo.

> [TMP 006/007](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11859) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

The TMP006 (and 007) can measure the temperature of an object without making contact with it, by using a thermopile to detect and absorb the infrared energy an object is emitting. This sensor also measures the temperature of the die (physical sensor).

### Humidity

> [DHT11, DHT22, AM2302](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging/wiring) (GPIO)

> [AM2315](https://github.com/lexruee/tentacle_pi) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

> [SHT10, SHT11, SHT15, SHT71, SHT75](https://github.com/mk-fg/sht-sensor) (GPIO)

NOTE: The Raspberry Pi uses 3.3-volts for powering the SHT sensor, however the default driver (sht-sensor) does not handle measurement calculations from 3.3-volts, only 3.5-volts. This can be easy corrected by setting the correct coefficient in driver (a future revision will fix this).

### Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)

> [K30](http://www.co2meters.com/Documentation/AppNotes/AN137-Raspberry-Pi.zip) (UART)

This documentation provides specific installation procedures for the K30 with the Raspberry Pi as well as example code. Once the K30 has been configured with this documentation, it can be tested whether the sensor is able to be read, by executing mycodo/tests/Test-Sensor-CO2-K30.py

UART is handled differently with the Raspberry Pi 3, because of bluetooth. Therefore, follow the instructions in the above link for Raspberry Pis 1 and 2, and the following instructions for the Raspberry pi 3:

Run raspi-config, go to Advanced Options->Serial and disable.

```sudo raspi-config```

edit /boot/config.txt and find the line "enable_uart=0" and change it to "enable_uart=1", then reboot.

### Pressure

> [BMP085/BMP180](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-the-bmp085-with-raspberry-pi) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

### Luminosity

> [TSL2561](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12055) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

The TSL2561 SparkFun Luminosity Sensor Breakout is a sophisticated light sensor which has a flat response across most of the visible spectrum. Unlike simpler sensors, the TSL2561 measures both infrared and visible light to better approximate the response of the human eye. And because the TSL2561 is an integrating sensor (it soaks up light for a predetermined amount of time), it is capable of measuring both small and large amounts of light by changing the integration time.

The TSL2561 is capable of direct I2C communication and is able to conduct specific light ranges from 0.1 - 40k+ Lux easily. Additionally, the TSL12561 contains two integrating analog-to-digital converters (ADC) that integrate currents from two photodiodes, simultaneously.

### Edge Detection

The detection of a changing digital signal (for instance, HIGH to LOW) requires the use of edge detection. The rising edge (LOW to HIGH), the falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both can be used to trigger events. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal should be equiped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the GPIO up (connected to power) or down (connected to ground). The option to enable the internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low.

Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect sensors, float switches, and more.

### Devices

> [TCA9548A I2C Multiplexer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/overview) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

The TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C allows multiple sensors that have the same I<sup>2</sup>C address to be used with mycodo (such as the AM2315). The multiplexer has a selectable address, from 0x70 through 0x77, allowing up to 8 multiplexers to be used at once. With 8 channels per multiplexer, this allows up to 64 devices with the same address to be used.

> [ADS1x15 Analog to Digital Converters](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

> [MCP243x Analog to Digital Converters](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/MCP3424_18-Bit_ADC-4_Channel_with_Programmable_Gain_Amplifier_(SKU:DFR0316)) (I<sup>2</sup>C)

An analog to digital converter (ADC) allows the use of any analog sensor that outputs a variable voltage. The detectable voltage range of this ADC is &plusmn;2.048 volts. A [voltage divider](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers) may be necessary to attain this range.


## Notes

A minimal set of anonymous usage statistics are collected to help improve development. No identifying information is saved from the information that is collected and it is only used to improve Mycodo. No other sources will have access to this information. The data collected is mainly how much specific features are used, how often errors occur, and other similar statistics. The data that's collected can be viewed from the 'View collected statistics' link in the Settings/General panel of the UI or in the file Mycodo/databases/statistics.csv. You may opt out from transmitting this information from the General settings in the Admin panel.

Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper is a binary executable used to update the system from the web interface. It has the setuid bit to permit it to be executed as root ('sudo update_mycodo.sh initialize' sets the correct permissions and setuid). Since shell scripts cannot be setuid (ony binary files), the mycodo_wrapper binay permits these operations to be executed as root by a non-root user (in this case, members of the group 'mycodo'). You can audit the source code of Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper.c and if you want to ensure the binary is indeed compiled from that source, you may compile it yourself with the following command. Otherwise, the compiled binary is already included and no further action is needed.

```sudo gcc ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper.c -o ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper```


## Installation

### Prerequisites

These install procedures have been tested to work with a Raspberry Pi following a fresh intall of [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

Set up the initial settings with raspi-config. **Don't skip the file system expansion and reboot! This needs to be done before continuing to install anything or there won't be any free disk space.**

```sudo raspi-config```

 + Change the default user (pi) password
 + Set the locale to en_US.UTF-8
 + Set the timezone (required for setting the proper time)
 + Enable I<sup>2</sup>C (required)
 + Enable Pi Camera support (optional)
 + Advanced A2: change the hostname (optional)
 + **Expand the file system (required)**
 + **Reboot**


The following install script will install or modify the default apache2 configurtion. If you require a custom setup, please examine and modify this script accordingly. If you do not require a cusom setup, just run the two commands below.

```
sudo apt-get install git -y
cd
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo
cd Mycodo
sudo ./setup.sh
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to create an administrator user for the web interface and to reboot at the very end.

If you want write access to the mycodo files, add your user to the mycodo group, changing 'username' to your user.

```sudo usermod -a -G mycodo username```

In certain circumstances after the initial install, the mycodo service will not be able to start because of a missing or corrupt package. I'm still trying to understand why this happens and how to prevent it. If you cannot start the daemon, try to resinstall the required modules with the following command, and then try:

```sudo pip install -r ~/Mycodo/requirements.txt --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-deps```

and reboot with ``sudo shutdown now -r```

The login page can be found at https://localhost/ (note the 's' in https)

If you receive an unresolvable error during the install, please [create an issue](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues).


### Enable I2C

Enable I<sup>2</sup>C support through raspi-config (and other options if not already done)

Edit /etc/modules and add 'i2c-bcm2708' to the last line of the file

```sudo vim /etc/modules```

Edit /boot/config.txt

```sudo vim /boot/config.txt```

and add the following two lines to the end of the file

```
dtparam=i2c1=on
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
```

Reboot

```sudo shutdown now -r```


### HTTP Server Security

SSL certificates will be generated and stored at ~/Mycodo/mycodo/frontend/ssl_certs/ during the install process. If you want to use your own SSL certificates, replace them as they are named in this directory. [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org) provides free verified SSL certificates.

If using the auto-generated certificate, be aware that they will not be verified when visiting the https:// version of the WEB UI. You will receive warning messages about the security of your site unless you add the certificate to your browser's trusted list). 


### Daemon info

The status of the daemon's service can be checked

```sudo service mycodo service```

The daemon can also be started manually if the systemd method above isn't used or an error needs to be debugged

```sudo ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py```

Also, use '-d' to log all debug messages to /var/log/mycodo/mycodo.log

```sudo ~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py -d```


### Upgrading

If you already have Mycodo installed (>=4.0.0), you can perform an upgrade to the latest version on github by either using the Admin/Update menu in the web UI or by issuing the following command at the terminal. Note: You must be a member of the group 'mycodo', else you will have to execute the following command as root. A log of the update process can be found at /var/log/mycodo/mycodoupdate.log

```~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/mycodo_wrapper upgrade```

Upgrading the mycodo database is performed automatically during the upgrade process, however it can also be performed manually with the following commands (Note: This does not create the database, only upgrade them. You must already have a database created in order to upgrade):

```cd ~/Mycodo/databases```

```alembic upgrade head```

Refer to the [alembic documentation](http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) for other functions.



### Restoring Backups

A backup is made when the system is upgraded. If you need to restore a backup, do the following, changing the appropriate directory names:

```
sudo mv ~/Mycodo ~/Mycodo_old
sudo cp -a /var/Mycodo-backups/Mycodo-TIME-COMMIT ~/Mycodo
sudo service mycodo restart
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```
