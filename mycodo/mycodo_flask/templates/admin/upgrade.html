    <p>You care currently running Mycodo <a href="https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/releases/tag/v4.2.0" target="_blank">4.2.0</a>. This is the last version of the 4.x releases and the last version that can be upgraded to from this web interface.</p>
    <p>Databases in the 4.x versions are not compatible with Mycodo 5.0, therefore a new Mycodo install will be required to use Mycodo 5.0. No settings or configurations will be transferred from 4.x to 5.0, so it is advisable to backup these settings by either saving the SQLite3 database (~/Mycodo/databases/mycodo.db) or writing down information (GPIO pins, PID settings, etc.), in order to reference those settings when configuring 5.0.</p>
    <p>If you would like to install Mycodo 5.0, execute the following commands in a terminal, as the user originally used to install Mycodo 4.x:</p>

    <pre>cd ~
cp ~/Mycodo/install/upgrade_mycodo_5.sh ~/
sudo /bin/bash ~/upgrade_mycodo_5.sh</pre>
