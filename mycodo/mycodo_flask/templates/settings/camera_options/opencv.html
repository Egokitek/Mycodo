Mycodo >= 5.5.0 does not support the opencv library, due to no binaries being available for opencv support for Python 3. Sorry for the inconvenience. If You know of a library or module that works with your camera, <a href="https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/new" target="_blank">contact the developer</a> and it may be integrated into Mycodo.
