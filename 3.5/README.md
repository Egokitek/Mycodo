# Mycodo 3.5-beta (experimental)

This is an experimental branch of mycodo. Unless I have been in direct contact with you regarding testing of this branch, I will not be providing technical support for any issues with this version. Instead, I recommend you check out the v3.0 stable branch.

- [ ] Capture series of photos at different ISOs, combine to make HDR photo
