# Mycodo 3.5-beta (experimental)

This is an experimental branch of mycodo. It is undergoing constant changes and may or may not work at any time (although it has matured somewhat and is relatively stable at the moment). If you are looking for a stable version, I recommend you check out the [v3.0 branch](../3.0).

## Software Install

This installation assumes you are starting with a fresh install of Raspbian linux on a Raspberry Pi. If not, adjust your installation accordingly. Once <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md" target="_blank">Raspbian has been installed</a> and the system is up and running, configure the system with raspi-config before doing anything else.

`sudo raspi-config`

Using raspi-config, perform the following:

 + Change the default user (pi) password
 + Set the locale to en_US.UTF-8 (Important! For some reason this isn't initially set)
 + Set the timezone (required for setting the proper time)
 + Enable the camera (optional)
 + Advanced A2: change the hostname (optional)
 + Expand the file system **Warning! This needs to be done before continuing to Prerequisites!**
 + Reboot

`sudo shutdown now -r`

`sudo ln -s /usr/include/linux/videodev2.h /usr/include/linux/videodev.h`

`sudo wget -P ~/ http://sourceforge.net/code-snapshots/svn/m/mj/mjpg-streamer/code/mjpg-streamer-code-182.zip`

`cd ~`

`unzip mjpg-streamer-code-182.zip`

`cd mjpg-streamer-code-182/mjpg-streamer`

`make mjpg_streamer input_file.so output_http.so`

`sudo cp mjpg_streamer /usr/local/bin`

`sudo cp output_http.so input_file.so /usr/local/lib/`

### Wifi

With a supported usb wifi dongle, setting up a wireless connection is as simple as the next few commands and a reboot. Consult documentation for your wireless card or google if this doesnâ€™t work. Edit wpa_supplicant.conf with `sudo vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` and add the following, change the name and password to that of your wifi network.

```
network={
    ssid="NAME"
    psk="PASSWORD"
}
```

### TempFS

A temporary file system in RAM can be created for areas of the disk that are written often, prolonging the life of the SD card and speeding up disk read/writes. Keep in mind that all content on temporary file systems will be lost upon reboot. If you need to analyze logs, remember to disable these lines in /etc/fstab before doing so.

Edit /etc/fstab with `sudo vi /etc/fstab` and add the following lines

```
tmpfs    /tmp    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=100m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/tmp    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=30m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/log    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=100m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/run    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=2m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/spool/mqueue    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0700,gid=12,size=30m    0 0
```

Using a tempfs does create some issues with certain software. Apache does not start if there is no directory structure in /var/log, and the designation of /var/log as a tempfs means that at every bootup this directory is empty. This init script will ensure that the proper directory structure is created at every boot, prior to Apache starting.

`sudo cp /var/www/mycodo/init.d/apache2-tmpfs /etc/init.d/`

`sudo chmod 0755 /etc/init.d/apache2-tmpfs`

`sudo update-rc.d apache2-tmpfs defaults 90 10`

### Resolve Hostnames

To allow resolving of IP addresses in the login log, edit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf with `sudo vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf` and find and change HostnameLookups to match the following line

`HostnameLookups On`

### Security

In each web-accessible directory is a file (.htaccess) which denies access to certain files and folders (such as the user database, sensor data, and camera photos). It is strongly recommended that you ensure this works properly (or alternatively, configure your web server to accomplish the same result), to ensure no one has direct access to these directories, as potentially sensitive information may be able to be accessed otherwise. Optionally, for higher security, enable SSL/HTTPS.

If your system is remotely accessible or publically available on the internet, it is strongly recommended to enable both SSL and .htaccess use. If your server is not, you can skip the next two steps.

#### Enable SSL

`sudo apt-get install openssl`

`sudo mkdir /etc/ssl/localcerts`

Generate your self-signed certificate with the following command. You will be prompted for information (which can be left blank), however it is recommended that if you have a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to enter that when prompted, to prevent a browser warning of a FQDN that doesn't match the certificate. The -days option specifies the certificate's expiration will be in 365 days.

`sudo openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/ssl/localcerts/apache.crt -keyout /etc/ssl/localcerts/apache.key`

`sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/localcerts/apache*`

Change the symlink from non-SSL to SSL

`sudo ln -sf /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default`

Edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default and make sure the top looks similar to this:

```
    <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost *:80>
            RewriteEngine on
            RewriteCond  %{HTTPS} !=on
            RewriteCond  %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*)$
            RewriteRule  ^(.*)/? https://%1$1 [L,R]
    </VirtualHost>
            
    <VirtualHost _default_:443>
    SSLEngine On
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/localcerts/apache.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/localcerts/apache.key

    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

    DocumentRoot /var/www/
    <Directory />
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride None
    </Directory>
    <Directory /var/www/>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
    </Directory>
```

Add `ServerName your.domain.com` to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Ensure SSL is enabled in apache2 and restart the server

`sudo a2enmod ssl`

`sudo service apache2 restart`

You will need to add the self-signed certificate that was created (/etc/ssl/localcerts/apache.pem) to your browser as trusted in order not to receive warnings. You can copy this from the /etc/ssl/localcerts/ directory or it can be obtained by visiting your server with your browser. The process for adding this file to your browser as trusted may be different for each browser, however there are many resources online that detail how to do so. Adding your certificate to your browser is highly recommended to ensure the site's certificate is what it's supposed to be, however you will still be able to access your site without adding the certificate, but you may receive a warning stating your site's security may be compromised.

#### Enable .htaccess

If your server is accessible from the internet but you don't want to enable SSL (this was enabled with SSL, above), this is a crucial step that will ensure sensitive files (images/logs/databases) will not be accessible to anyone. If your server is not publically accessible, you can skip this step. Otherwise, it's imperative that `AllowOverride All` is added to your apache2 config to allow the .htaccess files throughout mycodo to restrict access to certain files and folders. Modify /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default to appear as below:

```
    DocumentRoot /var/www
    <Directory />
         Order deny,allow
         Deny from all
    </Directory>
    <Directory /var/www>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>
```

### Enable mod_rewrite

`a2enmod rewrite`

Then restart apache with

`sudo service apache2 restart`

It is highly recommended that the configuration change be tested to determine if they actually worked. This can be done by going to https://yourwebaddress/mycodo/includes/ with your browser, and if you get an error, "Forbidden: You don't have permission to access /mycodo/includes on this server," or similar, then everything is working correctly. If the page actually loads or there is any other error than "forbidden", there is a problem and you should diagnose the issue before opening your server to beyond your local network.

### Database Creation

Use the following commands and type 'all' when prompted to create databases

`sudo /var/www/mycodo/update-database.py -i`

Follow the prompts to create an admin password, optionally create another user, and enable/disable guest access.

### Daemon

To initialize GPIO pins at startup, open crontab with `sudo crontab -e` and add the following lines, then save with `Ctrl+x`

`@reboot /usr/bin/python /var/www/mycodo/cgi-bin/GPIO-initialize.py &`

Last, set the daemon to automatically start

`sudo cp /var/www/mycodo/init.d/mycodo /etc/init.d/`

`sudo chmod 0755 /etc/init.d/mycodo`

`sudo update-rc.d mycodo defaults`

You can either reboot or start the daemon with the following command.

`sudo service mycodo start`

Note: cgi-bin/mycodo-wrapper is a binary executable used to start and stop the mycodo daemon from the web interface settings tab. It has the setuid bit to permit it to be executed as root (the init.d script sets the correct permissions and setuid). Since shell scripts cannot be setuid (ony binary files), mycodo-wrapper permits init.d/mycodo to be executed as root by a non-root user. All of this is done to allow the daemon to be stopped, started, and restarted in debug mode from the settings tab of the web interface. You can audit the source code in cgi-bin/mycodo-wrapper.c and if you want to ensure the binary is indeed compiled from the source, you may compile it yourself with the following command. Otherwise, the compiled binary is included and no further action is needed. I mention this to explain the need for setuid, for transparency, and security.

`gcc /var/www/mycodo/cgi-bin/mycodo-wrapper.c -o /var/www/mycodo/cgi-bin/mycodo-wrapper`

## Usage

### Web Interface

After the system is back up, go to http://your.rpi.address/mycodo and log in with the credentials you created with update-database.py. **Input fields of the web interface will display descriptions or instructions when the mouse is hovered over them.**

Ensure the Daemon indicator at the top-left is blue, indicating the daemon is running. If it is not, PID regulation cannot operate.

Additionally, relays must be properly set up before PID regulation can be achieved. Change the number of relays in the Settings tab and configure them. Change the `GPIO Pin` and `Signal ON` of each relay. The `GPIO Pin` is the pin on the raspberry pi (using BCM numbering, not board numbering) and the `Signal ON` is the required signal to activate the relay (close the circuit). If your relay activates when it receives a LOW signal (0-volt, Ground), set the `Signal ON` to 'Low', otherwise set it 'High'.

### System Update

If you have a fully-configured system, you may update to the latest version with the "Update Mycodo" button under the Advanced menu of the settings tab. A backup of the old system will be placed in the same directory the Mycodo main direcotry resides. For example, if this directory is /home/user/Mycodo, then the backup directory will reside at /home/user/Mycodo-backup.

Note: Logs and the user database will be preserved, however you will most likely need to reconfigure your settings and presets (a database updater is in the works). 

### Discrete PID Control

The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in industrial settings, for it's ability to handle both simple and complex regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional, integral, and derivative.

> The **P**roportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant K<sub>p</sub>, to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large proportional output.

> The **I**ntegral takes the error and multiplies it by K<sub>i</sub>, then integrates it (K<sub>i</sub> Â· 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will continually sum it and multiply it by the constant K<sub>i</sub>. The integral is used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using P alone produces an output that produces a perpetual error (if the measured sensor value never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.

> The **D**erivative multiplies the error by K<sub>d</sub>, then differentiates it (K<sub>d</sub> Â· s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path becomes, decreasing the output rate of change.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller" target="_blank">![](http://kylegabriel.com/images/PID_Animated.gif)</a>

Using temperature as an example, the process variable (PV) is the sensed temperature, the set point (SP) is the desired temperature, and the error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the three PID components, producing an output, called the manipulated variable (MV) or control variable (CV). To allow control of how much each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a value, called gains (represented as K, below). By adjusting the gains, the sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path does not contribute to the output and that path is eessentially turned off.

The output can be used a number of ways (as a simple on duration, a duty cycle, an aperature, an intensity of light, etc.), however the controller was designed to use the ouput to affect the sensed value (PV). This feedback loop, given proper calibration, should be able to bring the actual value to the desired value (reduce the error to 0) in a reasonable amount of time and maintain the desired value without much oscillation (fluctuation above and below the set point).

Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be aceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own. 

Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes P, I, and D can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance, the I and D can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the PI controller. It is recommended to start with only P activated, then experiment with PI, before finally using PID. Because systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.

### Quick Set-up Examples

These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure your P, I, and D variables. There are a number of online resources that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to determine ideal PID values (such as <a href="http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/167/what-are-good-strategies-for-tuning-pid-loops" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://innovativecontrols.com/blog/basics-tuning-pid-loops" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://hennulat.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/pid-loop-tuning-101/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://eas.uccs.edu/wang/ECE4330F12/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2558.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) and since there are no universal values that will work for every system, it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively implement them.

Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of P=30, I=1.0, and D=0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of P=1.0, I=0.2, and D=0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental chamber.

#### Exact Temperature Regulation

This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that cools).

Select the number of sensors that are connected. Select the proper device and GPIO pin for each sensor and activate logging and graphing.

***Stop here. Wait 10 minutes, then go the Main tab and generate a graph. If the graph generates with data on it, continue. If not, stop and investigate why there is no sensor data. The controller will not function if there is not sensor data being acquired.***

Under the Temperature PID for an active sensor, change `PID Set Point` to the desired temperature, `PID Regulate` to 'Both', and `PID Buffer` to 0 or 1. The Buffer will prevent PID regulation (i.e. not allow relays to operate), when the temperature falls within the Set Point Â± Buffer range. For instance, if the Set Point is 30Â°C and the Buffer is 1, this range would be 30Â°C Â± 1 = 29Â°C and 31Â°C.

Set the `Relay No.` of the up-regulating PID (represented by an Up arrow) to the relay attached to the heating device and the down-regulating PID to the relay attached to the coolong device.

Set `P` to 1, `I` to 0, `D` to 0, then turn the Temperature PID on with the ON button.

If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase the P value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with different configurations involving only `Read Interval` and `P` to achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the `I` and `D` from 0 until a working regulation is achieved with P alone.

Generate '6 Hour Seperate' graphs from the Main tab to identify how well the temperature is regulated to the Set Point. What is meant by well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with little oscillation.

Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing P slightly (~25%) and increasing `I` by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower), then observe how the controller regulates. Slowly increase I until regulation becomes both quick yet there is little oscillation once regulation is achieved. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with experimenting with the system and the D value can be experimented with.

#### High Temperature Regulation

Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed. For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the system and only up-regulation can be used.

Use the same configuration as the <a href="#exact-temperature-regulation">Exact Temperature Regulation</a> example, except change `PID Regulate` to 'Up' and change the `Relay No.` and `P`, `I`, and `D` values of the up-regulating PID (represented by an Up arrow). Buffer should be set to 0 when 'Both' is not used.

### Tips

#### PID Buffer

If regulation is set to 'Both' ways (up and down), the devices that regulate each direction may turn on excessively, essentially competing to maintain regulation of a precise Set Point. This is where the `PID Buffer` may be effective at reducing relay activity. By setting the PID Buffer greater than 0, a zone is formed (Set Point Â± Buffer) where relays will not activate while the environmental condition is measured within this range. For instance, if the Set Point is 30Â°C and the Buffer is 1, this range would be 30Â°C Â± 1 = 29Â°C and 31Â°C.
