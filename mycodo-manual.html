<h1 id="about-mycodo">About Mycodo</h1>
<p>Mycodo is a remote monitoring and automated regulation system with a focus on modulating environmental conditions. It was built to run on the Raspberry Pi (versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3) and aims to be easy to install and set up.</p>
<p>The core system coordinates a diverse set of responses to sensor measurements, including actions such as camera captures, email notifications, relay activation/deactivation, regulation with PID control, and more. Mycodo has been used for cultivating gourmet mushrooms, cultivating plants, culturing microorganisms, maintaining honey bee apiary homeostasis, incubating snake eggs and young animals, aging cheeses, fermenting foods, maintaining aquatic systems, and more.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller</a> is a control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little oscillation.</p>
<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><em>Where do I even begin?</em></p>
<p>Here is how I generally set up Mycodo to monitor and regulate:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Determine what environmental condition you want to measure or regulate. Consider the devices that must be coupled to achieve this. For instance, temperature regulation require a temperature sensor and an electric heater and/or electric air conditioner.</li>
<li>Determine what relays you will need to power your electric devices. The Raspberry Pi is capable of directly switching relays (using a 3.3-volt signal), although opto-isolating the circuit is advisable. Be careful when selecting a relay not to exceed the current draw of the Raspberry Pi’s PGIO.</li>
<li>See the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for information about what sensors are supported. Acquire one or more of these sensors and relays and connect them to the Raspberry Pi according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>
<li>On the <code>Sensors</code> page, create a new sensor, using the dropdown to select the correct sensor. Configure the sensor with the correct communication pins, etc. and save. Activate the sensor to begin recording measurements.</li>
<li>Go to the <code>Data</code> -&gt; <code>Live Measurements</code> page to ensure there is recent data being acquired from the sensor.</li>
<li>On the <code>Relay</code> -&gt; <code>Relays</code> page, add a relay and configure the GPIO pin that switches it, whether the relay switches On when the signal is HIGH or LOW, and what state (On or Off) to set the relay when Mycodo starts.</li>
<li>Test the relay by switching it On and Off from the <code>Relay</code> -&gt; <code>Relays</code> page and make sure the device connected to the relay turns On when you select “On”, and Off when you select “Off”.</li>
<li>On the <code>PID</code> -&gt; <code>PID Controllers</code> page, create a PID controller with the appropriate sensor, measurement, relay, and other parameters. Refer to the <a href="#quick-set-up-examples">Quick Setup Examples</a> for setting up and tuning a PID controller.</li>
<li>On the <code>Data</code> -&gt; <code>Live Graphs</code> page, create a graph that includes the sensor measurement, the relay that is being used by the PID, and the PID setpoint. This provides a good visualization for tuning and adjusting the system.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="relay-usage-settings">Relay Usage Settings</h2>
<p>In order to calculate accurate <a href="/usage">relay usage statistics</a>, a few characteristics of your electrical system needs to be know. These variables should describe the characteristics of the electrical system being used by the relays to operate electrical devices. Note: Proper relay usage calculations also rely on the correct current draw to be set for each relay (see <a href="/relay">Relay Options</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sensor-verification">Sensor Verification</h3>
<p>Sensor verification was introduced in an earlier version and was broken when the system moved to its new software framework. It was a great feature, and it’s planned to be integrated into the latest version.</p>
<p>This allows the verification of a sensor’s measurement with another sensor’s measurement. This feature is best utilized when you have two sensors in the same location (ideally as close as possible). One sensor (host) should be set up to use the other sensor (slave) to verify. The host sensor should be used to operate the PID, as one feature of the verification is the ability to disable the PID if the difference between measurements is not within the range specified.</p>

<h2 id="relays">Relays</h2>
<p>Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger voltage, without exposing the low -voltage system to the dangers of the higher voltage.</p>
<p>Relays must be properly set up before PID regulation can be achieved. Add and configure relays in the Relay tab. Set the “GPIO Pin” to the BCM GPIO number of each pin that activates each relay. <em>On Trigger</em> should be set to the signal that activates the relay (the device attached to the relay turns on). If your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 0-volts, set <em>On Trigger</em> to “Low”, otherwise if your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 3.3-volts (or whatever switching voltage you are using, if not being driven by the GPIO pin), set it to “High”.</p>
<p>When a relay is initially added, the background of the new relay will be yellow, indicating it is not configured. When properly configured, it will either turn green, indicating the relay is activated (device is on), or red, indicating the relay is inactivated (device is off).</p>

<h2 id="pids">PIDs</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller</a> is a control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little oscillation.</p>
<p>PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller resumes operation.</p>

<h2 id="conditional-statements">Conditional Statements</h2>
<p>A conditional statement is a way to perform certain actions based on whether a condition is true. Conditional statements can be created for both relays and sensors. Possible conditional statements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Relay #1 turns ON, turn Relay #3 ON</li>
<li>If Relay #1 turns ON, turn Relay #4 ON for 40 seconds and notify critical-issue@domain.com</li>
<li>If Relay #4 turns ON for 21 seconds, turn Relay #5 ON for 50 seconds</li>
<li>If Relay #4 turns ON for 20 seconds, turn Relay #1 OFF</li>
<li>If Humidity is Greater Than 80%, turn Relay #4 ON for 40 seconds</li>
<li>If Humidity if Less Than 50%, turn Relay #1 ON for 21 seconds, execute ‘/usr/local/bin/myscript.sh’, and notify email@domain.com</li>
<li>If Temperature if Greater Than 35 C, deactivate PID #1</li>
</ul>
<p>Before activating any conditional statements or PID controllers, it’s advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a configuration that eliminates conflicts. Then, trial run your configuration before connecting devices to the relays. Some devices or relays may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid succession. Therefore, avoid creating an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_%28computing%29#Infinite_loops">infinite loop</a> with conditional statements.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>Methods allow different types of setpoint tracking in PID controllers. Normally, a PID controller will regulate an environmental condition to a specific setpoint. If you would like the setpoint to change over time, this is called setpoint tracking. Setpoint tracking is useful for applications such as reflow ovens, thermal cyclers (DNA replication), mimicking natural daily cycles, and more.</p>

<h3 id="specific-method-options">Specific Method Options</h3>
<h4 id="timedate-method">Time/Date Method</h4>
<p>A time/date method allows a specific time/date span to dictate the setpoint. This is useful for long-running methods, that may take place over the period of days, weeks, or months.</p>
<h4 id="duration-method">Duration Method</h4>
<p>A duration method allows a specific durations of time to dictate the setpoint. This is useful for when short periods of time are required in a method, such as those that take place over the course of a few minutes or hours. Each duration will stack on the previous duration, meaning a newly-added start setpoint will begin from the previous entry’s end setpoint.</p>
<h4 id="daily-time-based-method">Daily (Time-Based) Method</h4>
<p>The daily time-based method is similar to the time/date method, however it will repeat every day. Therefore, it is essential that only the span of one day be set in this method. Begin with the start time at 00:00:00 and end at 23:59:59 (or 00:00:00, which would be 24 hours from the start). The start time must be equal or greater than the previous end time.</p>
<h4 id="daily-sine-wave-method">Daily (Sine Wave) Method</h4>
<p>The daily sine wave method defines the setpoint over the day based on a sinusoidal wave. The sine wave is defined by y = [A * sin(B * x + C)] + D, where A is amplitude, B is frequency, C is the angle shift, and D is the y-axis shift. This method will repeat daily.</p>
<h4 id="daily-bezier-curve-method">Daily (Bezier Curve) Method</h4>
<p>A daily Bezier curve method define the setpoint over the day based on a cubic Bezier curve. If unfamiliar with a Bezier curve, it is recommended you use the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cahqdxeshd">graphical Bezier curve generator</a> and use the 8 variables it creates for 4 points (each a set of x and y). The x-axis start (x3) and end (x0) will be automatically stretched or skewed to fit within a 24-hour period and this method will repeat daily.</p>
<h2 id="pid-tuning">PID Tuning</h2>
<h3 id="pid-control-theory">PID Control Theory</h3>
<p>The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in industrial settings, for it“s ability to handle both simple and complex regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional, integral, and derivative.</p>
<p>The <strong>P</strong>roportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant K<sub>p</sub>, to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large proportional output.</p>
<p>The <strong>I</strong>ntegral takes the error and multiplies it by K<sub>i</sub>, then integrates it (K<sub>i</sub> · 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will continually sum it and multiply it by the constant K<sub>i</sub>. The integral is used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using K<sub>p</sub> alone produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.</p>
<p>The <strong>D</strong>erivative multiplies the error by K<sub>d</sub>, then differentiates it (K<sub>d</sub> · s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point.</p>
<hr />
<p>Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a gain (represented by <em>K<sub>P</sub></em>, <em>K<sub>I</sub></em>, and <em>K<sub>D</sub></em>). By adjusting the gains, the sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned off.</p>
<p>The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This feedback loop, with a <em>properly tuned</em> PID controller, can achieve a set point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.</p>
<p>Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.</p>
<p>Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes <em>K<sub>P</sub></em>, <em>K<sub>I</sub></em>, and <em>K<sub>D</sub></em> can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance, the <em>K<sub>I</sub></em> and <em>K<sub>D</sub></em> can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the PI controller. It is recommended to start with only <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> activated, then experiment with <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> and <em>K<sub>I</sub></em>, before finally using all three. Because systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.</p>
<h3 id="quick-setup-examples">Quick Setup Examples</h3>
<p>These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure your <em>K<sub>P</sub></em>, <em>K<sub>I</sub></em>, and <em>K<sub>D</sub></em> gains. There are a number of online resources that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to determine ideal PID values (such as <a href="http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/167/what-are-good-strategies-for-tuning-pid-loops">here</a>, <a href="http://innovativecontrols.com/blog/basics-tuning-pid-loops">here</a>, <a href="https://hennulat.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/pid-loop-tuning-101/">here</a>, <a href="http://eas.uccs.edu/wang/ECE4330F12/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2558.pdf">here</a>) and since there are no universal values that will work for every system, it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively implement them.</p>
<p>Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> = 30, <em>K<sub>I</sub></em> = 1.0, and <em>K<sub>D</sub></em> = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> = 1.0, <em>K<sub>I</sub></em> = 0.2, and <em>K<sub>D</sub></em> = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental chamber.</p>
<h3 id="exact-temperature-regulation">Exact Temperature Regulation</h3>
<p>This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that cools).</p>
<p>Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each sensor and activate the sensor.</p>
<p>Add two relays, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.</p>
<p>Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change <em>Setpoint</em> to the desired temperature, <em>Regulate Direction</em> to “Both”. Set <em>Raise Relay</em> to the relay attached to the heating device and the <em>Lower Relay</em> to the relay attached to the cooling device.</p>
<p>Set <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> = 1, <em>K<sub>I</sub></em> = 0, and <em>K<sub>D</sub></em> = 0, then activate the PID.</p>
<p>If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase the <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with different configurations involving only <em>Read Interval</em> and <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> to achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the <em>K<sub>I</sub></em> and <em>K<sub>D</sub></em> from 0 until a working regulation is achieved with <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> alone.</p>
<p>View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with little oscillation around the Setpoint.</p>
<p>Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> slightly (~25%) and increasing <em>K<sub>I</sub></em> by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower, 0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates. Slowly increase <em>K<sub>I</sub></em> until regulation becomes both quick and with little oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with experimenting with the system and the <em>K<sub>D</sub></em> value can be experimented with once both <em>K<sub>P</sub></em> and <em>K<sub>I</sub></em> have been tuned.</p>
<h3 id="high-temperature-regulation">High Temperature Regulation</h3>
<p>Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed. For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the system and only up-regulation can be used.</p>
<p>Use the same configuration as the <a href="#exact-temperature-regulation">Exact Temperature Regulation</a> example, except change <em>Regulate Direction</em> to “Raise” and do not touch the “Down Relay” section.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h1>
<h2 id="graphs">Graphs</h2>
<p>There are two different types of graphs, Live and Asynchronous.</p>
<h3 id="live-graphs">Live Graphs</h3>
<p>A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning relatively short periods of time (hours/days/weeks). Select a time frame to view data and continually updating data from new sensor measurements. Multiple graphs can be created on one page that enables a dashboard to be created of graphed sensor data. Each graphs may have one or more sensor measurement, relay duration, or PID setpoint rendered onto it. Several live graph options exist, such as the time period (x-axis) and line colors, as well as navigation and data/image export options. To edit graph options, select the plus sign on the top-right of a graph.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous-graphs">Asynchronous Graphs</h3>
<p>A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Live Graph. Select a time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists. The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700 data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4 months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded. However, when viewing a 4 month span, it’s not possible to see every data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only ~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which time only another ~50kb is downloaded.</p>
<p>Note: Live Graphs require measurements to be acquired, therefore at least one sensor needs to be added and activated in order to display live data.</p>
<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>
<p>Once a cameras has been set up (in the <a href="#camera-settings">Camera Settings</a>), it may be used to capture still images, create time-lapses, and stream video. Cameras may also be used with <a href="#conditional-statements">Conditional Statements</a> to trigger a camera image or video capture (as well as the ability to email the image/video with a notification).</p>
<h2 id="relay-usage">Relay Usage</h2>
<p>Relay usage statistics are calculated for each relay, based on how long the relay has been powered, the current draw of the device connected to the relay, and other <a href="#relay-usage-settings">relay usage options</a>.</p>
<h2 id="system-backup">System Backup</h2>
<p>A backup is made to /var/Mycodo-backups when the system is upgraded through the web interface or the upgrade script.</p>

<h2 id="daemon-not-running">Daemon Not Running</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check the Logs: From the <code>[Gear Icon]</code> -&gt; <code>Mycodo Logs</code> page, check the Daemon Log for any errors. If the issue began after an upgrade, also check the Upgrade Log for indications of an issue.</li>
<li>Determine if the Daemon is Running: Execute <code>ps aux | grep '/var/www/mycodo/env/bin/python /var/www/mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py'</code> in a terminal and look for an entry to be returned. If nothing is returned, the daemon is not running.</li>
<li>Daemon Lock File: If the daemon is not running, make sure the daemon lock file is deleted at <code>/var/lock/mycodo.pid</code>. The daemon cannot start if the lock file is present.</li>
<li>If a solution could not be found after investigating the above suggestions, submit a <a href="https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/new">new Mycodo issue</a> on github.</li>
