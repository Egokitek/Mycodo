ABOUT MYCODO


Mycodo is a remote monitoring and automated regulation system with a
focus on modulating environmental conditions. It was built to run on the
Raspberry Pi (versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3) and aims to be easy to install
and set up.

The core system coordinates a diverse set of responses to sensor
measurements, including actions such as camera captures, email
notifications, relay activation/deactivation, regulation with PID
control, and more. Mycodo has been used for cultivating gourmet
mushrooms, cultivating plants, culturing microorganisms, maintaining
honey bee apiary homeostasis, incubating snake eggs and young animals,
aging cheeses, fermenting foods, maintaining aquatic systems, and more.

A proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller is a control loop
feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It
efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a
desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and
oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint
quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little
oscillation.



FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


_Where do I even begin?_

Here is how I generally set up Mycodo to monitor and regulate:

1.  Determine what environmental condition you want to measure
    or regulate. Consider the devices that must be coupled to achieve
    this. For instance, temperature regulation require a temperature
    sensor and an electric heater and/or electric air conditioner.
2.  Determine what relays you will need to power your electric devices.
    The Raspberry Pi is capable of directly switching relays (using a
    3.3-volt signal), although opto-isolating the circuit is advisable.
    Be careful when selecting a relay not to exceed the current draw of
    the Raspberry Pi’s PGIO.
3.  See the Device Specific Information for information about what
    sensors are supported. Acquire one or more of these sensors and
    relays and connect them to the Raspberry Pi according to the
    manufacturer’s instructions.
4.  On the Sensors page, create a new sensor, using the dropdown to
    select the correct sensor. Configure the sensor with the correct
    communication pins, etc. and save. Activate the sensor to begin
    recording measurements.
5.  Go to the Data -> Live Measurements page to ensure there is recent
    data being acquired from the sensor.
6.  On the Relay -> Relays page, add a relay and configure the GPIO pin
    that switches it, whether the relay switches On when the signal is
    HIGH or LOW, and what state (On or Off) to set the relay when
    Mycodo starts.
7.  Test the relay by switching it On and Off from the Relay -> Relays
    page and make sure the device connected to the relay turns On when
    you select “On”, and Off when you select “Off”.
8.  On the PID -> PID Controllers page, create a PID controller with the
    appropriate sensor, measurement, relay, and other parameters. Refer
    to the Quick Setup Examples for setting up and tuning a
    PID controller.
9.  On the Data -> Live Graphs page, create a graph that includes the
    sensor measurement, the relay that is being used by the PID, and the
    PID setpoint. This provides a good visualization for tuning and
    adjusting the system.

_Why is there only one FAQ?_

Good question.

Relay Usage Settings

In order to calculate accurate relay usage statistics, a few
characteristics of your electrical system needs to be know. These
variables should describe the characteristics of the electrical system
being used by the relays to operate electrical devices. Note: Proper
relay usage calculations also rely on the correct current draw to be set
for each relay (see Relay Settings).

Users

Mycodo requires at least one Admin user for the login system to be
enabled. If there isn’t an Admin user, the web server will redirect to
an Admin Creation Form. This is the first page you see when starting
Mycodo for the first time. After an Admin user has been created,
additional users may be created from the User Settings page.

Camera Settings

Many cameras can be used simultaneously with Mycodo. Each camera needs
to be set up in the camera settings, then may be used throughout the
software. Note that not every option (such as Hue or White Balance) may
be able to be used with your particular camera, due to manufacturer
differences in hardware and software.

CONTROLLERS


Controllers are essentially modules that can be used to perform
functions or communicate with other parts of Mycodo. Each controller
performs a specific task or group of related tasks. There are also
Controller Functions, which are larger functions of a controller or
controllers and have been given their own sections.


Sensors

Sensors measure environmental conditions, which will be stored in an
influx database. This database will provide recent measurement for
Conditional Statements or PID Controllers to operate from, among other
uses.

Sensor Verification

Sensor verification was introduced in an earlier version and was broken
when the system moved to its new software framework. It was a great
feature, and it’s planned to be integrated into the latest version.

This allows the verification of a sensor’s measurement with another
sensor’s measurement. This feature is best utilized when you have two
sensors in the same location (ideally as close as possible). One sensor
(host) should be set up to use the other sensor (slave) to verify. The
host sensor should be used to operate the PID, as one feature of the
verification is the ability to disable the PID if the difference between
measurements is not within the range specified.

Relays

Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small
voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger
voltage, without exposing the low -voltage system to the dangers of the
higher voltage.

Relays must be properly set up before PID regulation can be achieved.
Add and configure relays in the Relay tab. Set the “GPIO Pin” to the BCM
GPIO number of each pin that activates each relay. _On Trigger_ should
be set to the signal that activates the relay (the device attached to
the relay turns on). If your relay activates when the potential across
the coil is 0-volts, set _On Trigger_ to “Low”, otherwise if your relay
activates when the potential across the coil is 3.3-volts (or whatever
switching voltage you are using, if not being driven by the GPIO pin),
set it to “High”.

When a relay is initially added, the background of the new relay will be
yellow, indicating it is not configured. When properly configured, it
will either turn green, indicating the relay is activated (device is
on), or red, indicating the relay is inactivated (device is off).

PIDs

A proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller is a control loop
feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It
efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a
desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and
oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint
quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little
oscillation.

PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new
settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the
controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller
resumes operation.

Timers

Timers enable a relay to be manipulated after specific durations of time
or at a specific times of the day. For _Duration Timers_, both the on
duration and the off duration can be defined and the timer will be
turned on and off for those durations until deactivated. For _Daily
Timers_, the start hour:minute can be set to turn a specific relay on or
off at the specific time of day.


LCDs

Data may be output to a liquid crystal display (LCD) for easy viewing.
There are only a few number fo LCDs that are supported. Only 16x2 and
20x4 character LCD displays with I2C backpacks are supported. Please see
the README for specific information regarding compatibility.

CONTROLLER FUNCTIONS


Conditional Statements

A conditional statement is a way to perform certain actions based on
whether a condition is true. Conditional statements can be created for
both relays and sensors. Possible conditional statements include:

-   If Relay #1 turns ON, turn Relay #3 ON
-   If Relay #1 turns ON, turn Relay #4 ON for 40 seconds and notify
    critical-issue@domain.com
-   If Relay #4 turns ON for 21 seconds, turn Relay #5 ON for 50 seconds
-   If Relay #4 turns ON for 20 seconds, turn Relay #1 OFF
-   If Humidity is Greater Than 80%, turn Relay #4 ON for 40 seconds
-   If Humidity if Less Than 50%, turn Relay #1 ON for 21 seconds,
    execute ‘/usr/local/bin/myscript.sh’, and notify email@domain.com
-   If Temperature if Greater Than 35 C, deactivate PID #1

Before activating any conditional statements or PID controllers, it’s
advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a
configuration that eliminates conflicts. Then, trial run your
configuration before connecting devices to the relays. Some devices or
relays may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid
succession. Therefore, avoid creating an infinite loop with conditional
statements.

Methods

Methods allow different types of setpoint tracking in PID controllers.
Normally, a PID controller will regulate an environmental condition to a
specific setpoint. If you would like the setpoint to change over time,
this is called setpoint tracking. Setpoint tracking is useful for
applications such as reflow ovens, thermal cyclers (DNA replication),
mimicking natural daily cycles, and more.

Universal Options

These options are shared with several method types.

  Setting           Description
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  Start Time/Date   This is the start time of a range of time.
  End Time/Date     This is the end time of a range of time.
  Start Setpoint    This is the start setpoint of a range of setpoints.
  End Setpoint      This is the end setpoint of a range of setpoints.

Specific Method Options

Time/Date Method

A time/date method allows a specific time/date span to dictate the
setpoint. This is useful for long-running methods, that may take place
over the period of days, weeks, or months.

Duration Method

A duration method allows a specific durations of time to dictate the
setpoint. This is useful for when short periods of time are required in
a method, such as those that take place over the course of a few minutes
or hours. Each duration will stack on the previous duration, meaning a
newly-added start setpoint will begin from the previous entry’s end
setpoint.

Daily (Time-Based) Method

The daily time-based method is similar to the time/date method, however
it will repeat every day. Therefore, it is essential that only the span
of one day be set in this method. Begin with the start time at 00:00:00
and end at 23:59:59 (or 00:00:00, which would be 24 hours from the
start). The start time must be equal or greater than the previous end
time.

Daily (Sine Wave) Method

The daily sine wave method defines the setpoint over the day based on a
sinusoidal wave. The sine wave is defined by y = [A * sin(B * x + C)] +
D, where A is amplitude, B is frequency, C is the angle shift, and D is
the y-axis shift. This method will repeat daily.

Daily (Bezier Curve) Method

A daily Bezier curve method define the setpoint over the day based on a
cubic Bezier curve. If unfamiliar with a Bezier curve, it is recommended
you use the graphical Bezier curve generator and use the 8 variables it
creates for 4 points (each a set of x and y). The x-axis start (x3) and
end (x0) will be automatically stretched or skewed to fit within a
24-hour period and this method will repeat daily.


PID Tuning

PID Control Theory

The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in
industrial settings, for it“s ability to handle both simple and complex
regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional,
integral, and derivative.

The Proportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant Kp,
to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large
proportional output.

The Integral takes the error and multiplies it by Ki, then integrates it
(Ki · 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will
continually sum it and multiply it by the constant Ki. The integral is
used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using Kp alone
produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor
measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the
output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.

The Derivative multiplies the error by Kd, then differentiates it (Kd ·
s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will
change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path
becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of
dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the
measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and
the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the
desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or
too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the
three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated
Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much
each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a
gain (represented by _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_). By adjusting the gains, the
sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths
are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path
does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned
off.

The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was
designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This
feedback loop, with a _properly tuned_ PID controller, can achieve a set
point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little
oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.

Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a
temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and
cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value
would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would
rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a
lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the
error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the
temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be
acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative
output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the
temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would
normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can
be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.

Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_
can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance,
the _KI_ and _KD_ can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and
producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the
PI controller. It is recommended to start with only _KP_ activated, then
experiment with _KP_ and _KI_, before finally using all three. Because
systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the
degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need
to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.

Quick Setup Examples

These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation
in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure
your _KP_, _KI_, and _KD_ gains. There are a number of online resources
that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to
determine ideal PID values (such as here, here, here, here, and here)
and since there are no universal values that will work for every system,
it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the
variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively
implement them.

Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my
setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of _KP_ = 30, _KI_ =
1.0, and _KD_ = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of _KP_ =
1.0, _KI_ = 0.2, and _KD_ = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have
been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental
chamber.

Exact Temperature Regulation

This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a
certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that
cools).

Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each
sensor and activate the sensor.

Add two relays, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.

Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change _Setpoint_ to
the desired temperature, _Regulate Direction_ to “Both”. Set _Raise
Relay_ to the relay attached to the heating device and the _Lower Relay_
to the relay attached to the cooling device.

Set _KP_ = 1, _KI_ = 0, and _KD_ = 0, then activate the PID.

If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should
activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the
temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than
the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate
until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is
not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase
the _KP_ value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with
different configurations involving only _Read Interval_ and _KP_ to
achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the _KI_ and _KD_ from 0 until
a working regulation is achieved with _KP_ alone.

View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the
temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by
well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and
tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the
proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with
little oscillation around the Setpoint.

Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing _KP_ slightly (~25%)
and increasing _KI_ by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower,
0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates.
Slowly increase _KI_ until regulation becomes both quick and with little
oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with
experimenting with the system and the _KD_ value can be experimented
with once both _KP_ and _KI_ have been tuned.

High Temperature Regulation

Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed.
For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the
system and only up-regulation can be used.

Use the same configuration as the Exact Temperature Regulation example,
except change _Regulate Direction_ to “Raise” and do not touch the “Down
Relay” section.



MISCELLANEOUS


Graphs

There are two different types of graphs, Live and Asynchronous.

Live Graphs

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning
relatively short periods of time (hours/days/weeks). Select a time frame
to view data and continually updating data from new sensor measurements.
Multiple graphs can be created on one page that enables a dashboard to
be created of graphed sensor data. Each graphs may have one or more
sensor measurement, relay duration, or PID setpoint rendered onto it.
Several live graph options exist, such as the time period (x-axis) and
line colors, as well as navigation and data/image export options. To
edit graph options, select the plus sign on the top-right of a graph.

Asynchronous Graphs

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning
relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be
very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Live Graph. Select a
time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists.
The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every
view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700
data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be
created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables
much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4
months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded.
However, when viewing a 4 month span, it’s not possible to see every
data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is
inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what
you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only
~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which
time only another ~50kb is downloaded.

Note: Live Graphs require measurements to be acquired, therefore at
least one sensor needs to be added and activated in order to display
live data.


Camera

Once a cameras has been set up (in the Camera Settings), it may be used
to capture still images, create time-lapses, and stream video. Cameras
may also be used with Conditional Statements to trigger a camera image
or video capture (as well as the ability to email the image/video with a
notification).


Relay Usage

Relay usage statistics are calculated for each relay, based on how long
the relay has been powered, the current draw of the device connected to
the relay, and other Relay Usage Settings.


System Backup

A backup is made to /var/Mycodo-backups when the system is upgraded
through the web interface or the upgrade script.


System Restore

If you need to restore a backup, do the following, changing the
appropriate directory names with these commands, changing ‘user’ to your
user name:

    sudo mv /home/user/Mycodo /home/user/Mycodo_old
    sudo cp -a /var/Mycodo-backups/Mycodo-TIME-COMMIT /home/user/Mycodo
    sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycoco/scripts/upgrade_post.sh



TROUBLESHOOTING


Daemon Not Running

-   Check the Logs: From the [Gear Icon] -> Mycodo Logs page, check the
    Daemon Log for any errors. If the issue began after an upgrade, also
    check the Upgrade Log for indications of an issue.
-   Determine if the Daemon is Running: Execute
    ps aux | grep '/var/www/mycodo/env/bin/python /var/www/mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_daemon.py'
    in a terminal and look for an entry to be returned. If nothing is
    returned, the daemon is not running.
-   Daemon Lock File: If the daemon is not running, make sure the daemon
    lock file is deleted at /var/lock/mycodo.pid. The daemon cannot
    start if the lock file is present.
-   If a solution could not be found after investigating the above
    suggestions, submit a New Mycodo Issue on github.

SENSOR AND DEVICE SETUP


Certain sensors will require extra steps to be taken in order to set up
the interface for communication. This includes I2C, one-wire, and UART.


Sensor Interfaces

Sensors are categorized below by their communication interface.

1-Wire

The 1-wire interface should be configured with these instructions.

  DS18B20: Temperature link (Also works with: DS18S20, DS1822, DS28EA00,
  DS1825/MAX31850K)

GPIO

  DHT11, DHT22/AM2302: Relative humidity and temperature link

  SHT1x/SHT7x, SHT2x: Relative humidity and temperature link

UART

  Atlas Scientific pH: pH link K30: Carbon dioxide (CO2) in ppmv link

This documentation provides specific installation procedures for
configuring UART for the K30 with the Raspberry Pi version 1 or 2. Once
the K30 has been configured with this documentation, it can be tested
whether the sensor is able to be read, by executing
~/Mycodo/mycodo/tests/manual_tests/test_uart_K30.py

For Atlas Scientific sensors, this guide may be used, as well as the
above K-30 guide, to set up UART on the Raspberry Pi 1 and 2. However,
for Pi 3s, use the procedure below.

Because the UART is handled differently by the Raspberry Pi 3, from of
the addition of bluetooth, there are a different set of instructions for
getting the K30 working on the Raspberry Pi 3. If installing on a
Raspberry Pi 3, you only need to perform these steps to get the K30
working:

Run raspi-config

sudo raspi-config

Go to Advanced Options -> Serial and disable. Then edit /boot/config.txt

sudo vi /boot/config.txt

Find the line “enable_uart=0” and change it to “enable_uart=1”, then
reboot.

I2C

The I2C interface should be enabled with raspi-config.

  AM2315: Relative humidity, temperature link

  Atlas Scientific PT-1000: Temperature link

  BH1750: Light link

  BME280: Barometric pressure, humidity, temperature link

  BMP085, BMP180: Barometric pressure, temperature link

  HTU21D: Relative humidity and temperature link

  TMP006, TMP007: Contactless temperature link

  TSL2561: Light link

  Chirp: link Moisture, light, and temperature


Edge Detection

The detection of a changing signal, for instance a simple switch
completing a circuit, requires the use of edge detection. By detecting a
rising edge (LOW to HIGH), a falling edge (HIGH to LOW), or both,
actions or events can be triggered. The GPIO chosen to detect the signal
should be equipped with an appropriate resistor that either pulls the
GPIO up [to 5-volts] or down [to ground]. The option to enable the
internal pull-up or pull-down resistors is not available for safety
reasons. Use your own resistor to pull the GPIO high or low.

Examples of devices that can be used with edge detection: simple
switches and buttons, PIR motion sensors, reed switches, hall effect
sensors, float switches, and more.


Device Setup

I2C Multiplexers

All devices that connected to the Raspberry Pi by the I2C bus need to
have a unique address in order to communicate. Some sensors may have the
same address (such as the AM2315), which prevents more than one from
being connected at the same time. Others may provide the ability to
change the address, however the address range may be limited, which
limits by how many you can use at the same time. I2C multiplexers are
extremely clever and useful in these scenarios because they allow
multiple sensors with the same I2C address to be connected.

  TCA9548A: I2C Multiplexer link (I2C): Has 8 selectable addresses, so 8
  multiplexers can be connected to one Raspberry Pi. Each multiplexer
  has 8 channels, allowing up to 8 devices/sensors with the same address
  to be connected to each multiplexer. 8 multiplexers x 8 channels = 64
  devices/sensors with the same I2C address.

  TCA9545A: I2C Bus Multiplexer link (I2C): This board works a little
  differently than the TCA9548A, above. This board actually creates 4
  new I2C busses, each with their own selectable voltage, either 3.3 or
  5.0 volts. Instructions to enable the Device Tree Overlay are at
  https://github.com/camrex/i2c-mux-pca9545a. Nothing else needs to be
  done in Mycodo after that except to select the correct I2C bus when
  configuring a sensor.

Analog to Digital Converters

An analog to digital converter (ADC) allows the use of any analog sensor
that outputs a variable voltage. A voltage divider may be necessary to
attain your desired range.

  ADS1x15 link ±4.096 (I2C)

  MCP342x link ±2.048 (I2C)

The BH1750 is an I2C luminosity sensor that provides a digital value in
lux (Lx) over a range of 1 - 65535 lx.

TSL2561

The TSL2561 SparkFun Luminosity Sensor Breakout is a sophisticated light
sensor which has a flat response across most of the visible spectrum.
Unlike simpler sensors, the TSL2561 measures both infrared and visible
light to better approximate the response of the human eye. And because
the TSL2561 is an integrating sensor (it soaks up light for a
predetermined amount of time), it is capable of measuring both small and
large amounts of light by changing the integration time.
