Mycodo is an automated monitoring and regulation system that was built
to run on the `Raspberry
Pi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi>`__ (versions Zero, 1, 2,
and 3).

Originally designed to cultivate edible mushrooms, Mycodo has grown to
include the ability to do much more, including cultivating plants,
culturing microorganisms, maintaining honey bee apiary homeostasis,
incubating animals and eggs, maintaining aquatic systems, aging cheeses,
fermenting foods and tobacco, cooking food (vous-vide), and more.

The system comprises a backend (daemon) and a frontend (user interface).
The backend conducts measurements from sensors and devices, then
coordinate a diverse set of responses to those measurements, including
the ability to modulate outputs (relays, PWM, wireless outlets),
regulate environmental conditions with electrical devices under PID
control (steady regulation or changing over time), schedule timers,
capture photos and stream video, trigger actions when measurements meet
certain conditions (modulate relays, execute commands, notify by email,
etc.), and more. The frontend is a web interface that enables easy
navigation and configuration from any browser-enabled device.

What is PID Control?
--------------------

A `proportional-derivative-integral (PID)
controller <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller>`__ is a
control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling
systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as
temperature, to a desired state (setpoint). A well-tuned PID controller
can raise to a setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain
the setpoint with little oscillation.

The top graph visualizes the regulation of temperature. The red line is
the desired temperature (setpoint) that has been configured to change
over the course of each day. The blue line is the actual recorded
temperature. The green vertical bars represent how long a heater has
been activated for every 20-second period. This regulation was achieved
with minimal tuning, and already displays a very minimal deviation from
the setpoint (±0.5° Celsius). Further tuning would reduce this
variability further.

Software Features
-----------------

-  Inputs: Periodically measure devices, such as analog-to-digital
   converters (ADCs), sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.), or add your
   own.
-  Outputs: Manipulate the environment by switching GPIO pins High or
   Low, switching relays, generating PWM signals, email notifications,
   executing linux commands, and more.
-  PID Controllers: Couple inputs with outputs to create feedback loops
   in order to regulate environmental conditions.
-  Methods: Change the desired condition over time (useful for reflow
   ovens, thermal cyclers, mimicking natural environmental changes,
   etc.)
-  Timers: Schedule the execution of actions at various times and
   intervals.
-  LCDs: Display measurements and data on 16x2 and 20x4 I2C-enabled LCD
   displays.
-  I2C Multiplexer Support: Allow multiple devices/sensors with the same
   I2C address to be used simultaneously.
-  Camera support: Raspberry Pi Camera and USB cameras, to stream live
   video (only Pi cam), capture still images and video, and create
   time-lapses.
-  Web Interface: Access using a web browser on your local network or
   anywhere in the world with an internet connection.
-  Secure Login: High-security login system utilizing the latest
   encryption and authorization standards.
-  System upgrade: When a new version is released on github, an upgrade
   can be initiated from the web interface.
-  Languages: English, `Español (Spanish) <#espa%C3%B1ol-spanish>`__
   (partial: `Français (French) <#fran%C3%A7ais-french>`__) (Change
   language under Configure -> Language)

`Read the manual <#manual>`__ for details.

Supported Inputs
----------------

All supported Inputs can be found under `Sensor
Interfaces <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/blob/master/mycodo-manual.rst#sensor-interfaces>`__
and `Device
Setup <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/blob/master/mycodo-manual.rst#device-setup>`__.

Install
-------

These install procedures have been tested to work with the Raspberry Pi
(versions Zero, 1, 2, and 3) following a fresh install of
`Raspbian <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>`__ (Full or
Lite version), with an active internet connection.

Once Raspbian has been installed, follow the guide below to set up the
system prior to installing Mycodo.

Configure raspi-config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**It's very important that you don't skip the file system expansion and
reboot steps! These need to be done before continuing or there won't be
enough free disk space to install Mycodo.**

After writing Raspbian to an SD card and enabling ssh by creating a file
named ``ssh`` on the boot partition, insert the SD card into the Pi and
power the system. Whether you log in with the GUI or terminal via SSH to
your Raspberry Pi's IP address for the first time (user: pi, password:
raspberry), issue the following command to start raspi-config and set
the following options.

::

    sudo raspi-config

Then change the following settings

-  ``Change User Password`` (change the password from the default
   'raspberry')
-  ``Localisation Options`` -> ``Change Locale`` (set and select
   en\_US.UTF-8, if US)
-  ``Localisation Options`` -> ``Change Timezone``
-  ``Interfacing Options`` -> ``SSH`` -> ``Enable``
-  ``Advanced Options`` -> ``Expand Filesystem`` (***required***)
-  Reboot (***required***)

Install Mycodo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mycodo will be installed by executing setup.sh. As a part of the
installation, you will be prompted with a few options to determine which
components to install and configure.

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install -y jq
    cd ~
    curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kizniche/Mycodo/releases/latest | \
    jq -r '.tarball_url' | wget -i - -O mycodo-latest.tar.gz
    mkdir Mycodo
    tar xzf mycodo-latest.tar.gz -C Mycodo --strip-components=1
    rm -f mycodo-latest.tar.gz
    cd Mycodo/install
    sudo /bin/bash ./setup.sh

Make sure the setup.sh script finishes without errors. A log of the
setup.sh script output will be created at
``~/Mycodo/install/setup.log``.

If the install is successful, the web user interface should be
accessible by navigating a web browser to ``https://0.0.0.0/``,
replacing ``0.0.0.0`` with your Raspberry Pi's IP address. The first
time you visit this page, you will be prompted to create an admin user.
After creating an admin user, you will be redirected to the login page.
Once logged in, make sure the host name and version number at the top
left is green, indicating the daemon is running. Red indicates the
daemon is inactive or unresponsive. Ensure any java-blocking plugins are
disabled for all parts of the web interface to function properly.

Install Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want write access to the mycodo files, add your user to the
mycodo group, changing 'pi' to your user if it differs, then re-log in
for the changes to take effect.

::

    sudo adduser pi mycodo

In certain circumstances after the initial install or an upgrade, the
mycodo daemon will not be able to start because of a missing or corrupt
pip package. I'm still trying to understand why this happens and how to
prevent it. If you cannot start the daemon, try to reinstall the
required python modules with the following command:

::

    sudo ~/Mycodo/env/bin/pip install -r ~/Mycodo/install/requirements.txt --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-deps

Then reboot

::

    sudo shutdown now -r

If you receive an unresolvable error during the install, please `create
an issue <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues>`__. If you want to
try to diagnose the issue yourself, see `Diagnosing
Issues <#diagnosing-issues>`__.

A minimal set of anonymous usage statistics are collected to help
improve development. No identifying information is saved from the
information that is collected and it is only used to improve Mycodo. No
other sources will have access to this information. The data collected
is mainly how much specific features are used, and other similar
statistics. The data that's collected can be viewed from the 'View
collected statistics' link in the Settings -> General page or in the
file ``~/Mycodo/databases/statistics.csv``. You may opt out from
transmitting this information in the General settings.

Web Server Security
-------------------

An SSL certificate will be generated (expires in 10 years) and stored at
``~/Mycodo/mycodo/mycodo_flask/ssl_certs/`` during the install process
to allow SSL to be used to securely connect to the web interface. If you
want to use your own SSL certificates, replace them with your own.

If using the auto-generated certificate from the install, be aware that
it will not be verified when visiting the web interface using the
``https://`` address prefix (opposed to ``http://``). You may
continually receive a warning message about the security of your site,
unless you add the certificate to your browser's trusted list.

Upgrade
-------

Mycodo can be easily upgraded from the web interface by selecting
``Upgrade`` from the configuration menu. Alternatively, an upgrade can
be initiated from a terminal with the following command:

::

    sudo /bin/bash ~/Mycodo/mycodo/scripts/upgrade_commands.sh upgrade
