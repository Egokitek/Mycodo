    A side effect of performing a Mycodo upgrade that migrates all the code
    form Python 2 to Python 3 is a bug emerges for using a cookie generated
    with Flask running on Python 2, with the new Flask running on Python 3.

    Consequently, all users will see Flask throw an error, rendering the web
    user interface useless and leading the user to believe Mycodo is broken,
    when in fact the issue would be resolved by merely deleting the browser
    cookie.

    Using alembic to delete the flask_secret_key will ensure this only occurs
    once, when the user upgrades to a Mycodo version => 5.5.0.
